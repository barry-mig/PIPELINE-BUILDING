# DISSECTING YOUR ML_PIPELINE_API.PY - THE REAL-TIME MAGIC

"""
Let's examine YOUR code and see exactly what gives it real-time capabilities
"""

# 1. PERSISTENT SERVICE (Always Running)
"""
In your ml_pipeline_api.py:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)

This creates a SERVER that runs 24/7, always ready to respond.
No startup delays - it's ALWAYS listening for requests.
"""

# 2. IN-MEMORY MODEL REGISTRY (Instant Access)
"""
In your code:

model_registry = {
    "v1.0": {"accuracy": 0.85, "status": "active"},
    "v1.1": {"accuracy": 0.87, "status": "testing"}, 
    "v2.0": {"accuracy": 0.89, "status": "development"}
}

This data is in RAM - accessible in microseconds.
No database queries or file reads during prediction.
"""

# 3. ASYNC PROCESSING (Handle Multiple Requests)
"""
In your predict function:

@app.post("/predict", response_model=PredictionResponse)
async def predict(data: DataInput):  # ‚Üê 'async' enables concurrency
    
The 'async' keyword means your API can handle 100s of simultaneous 
predictions without blocking each other.
"""

# 4. INSTANT HTTP RESPONSES
"""
Your predict endpoint:

return PredictionResponse(
    prediction=prediction,
    confidence=confidence,
    model_version="v1.1",
    timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat(),  # ‚Üê Current moment
    request_id=str(uuid.uuid4())
)

This returns immediately - no waiting for batch jobs or file I/O.

    }

# 5. BACKGROUND TASKS (Non-blocking Operations)
"""
Your code includes:

@app.post("/pipeline/start")
async def start_pipeline(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, request: TrainingRequest):
    background_tasks.add_task(simulate_pipeline_execution, pipeline_id)
    
    return {
        "message": "Pipeline started successfully",
        "pipeline_id": pipeline_id,
        "track_url": f"/pipeline/status/{pipeline_id}"

This returns IMMEDIATELY while training runs in background.
User doesn't wait - gets instant confirmation and tracking ID.
"""

# 6. HEALTH CHECKS (Always Available)
"""
Your health endpoint:

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
