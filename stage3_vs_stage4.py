# STAGE 3 vs STAGE 4: The Key Differences

"""
STAGE 3: PRODUCTION READY (Internal/Testing)
- Your API works and is stable
- Running on your servers
- Internal teams can use it
- Limited, controlled access
- Performance testing
- Final validation

STAGE 4: DEPLOYMENT (Live/Public)
- API is integrated with real applications
- Serving actual users/customers
- Scaled infrastructure
- Monitoring and alerts
- Business impact tracking

    STAGE 3: API is ready, tested, and stable
    - Running on internal servers
    - QA team is testing it
    - Product team is validating results
    - Performance benchmarks met
    - But NOT yet serving real customers

# STAGE 4 EXAMPLE: Deployed and Integrated
"""
STAGE 4: The SAME API is now integrated into:

1. CUSTOMER WEBSITE:
   - When user visits checkout page
   - Website calls: POST /predict {"customer_id": 12345}
   - If high churn risk → Show discount popup
   - Real customers see real results

2. MOBILE APP:
   - Push notification system
   - Calls API for all active users
   - Sends personalized retention offers

3. EMAIL MARKETING:
   - Daily batch job
   - Calls API for 1 million customers
   - Generates targeted email campaigns

4. CUSTOMER SERVICE:
   - Agent dashboard
   - Real-time churn scores
   - Helps agents prioritize calls

    "monitoring": "Basic performance metrics",
    "integration": "Standalone API, manual testing",
    "business_impact": "Zero - no real customers affected",
    "goal": "Prove the API is ready for prime time",
    "mindset": "Can we deploy this safely?"

STAGE_4_CHARACTERISTICS = {
    "environment": "Live production serving real users",
    "users": "Actual customers/end-users",
    "traffic": "Real user traffic, unpredictable patterns",
    "monitoring": "Full observability, alerts, dashboards",

    "goal": "Maximize business value from ML model",
    "mindset": "How do we scale and optimize for impact?"

# REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:

"""
STAGE 3 = DRESS REHEARSAL
- Restaurant kitchen is ready
- All equipment works
- Chef knows all recipes
- Staff has practiced
- But restaurant is closed to public
- Only food critics and investors taste the food

STAGE 4 = GRAND OPENING
- Same kitchen, same recipes
- Now serving paying customers
- Lines out the door
- Reviews on Yelp affect business
- Kitchen must handle rush hours
- Success measured by profit and customer satisfaction
