2. **Batch file uploads** - CSV/JSON files with customer batches
3. **Database connections** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB support
4. **Streaming data** - Real-time customer event streams
5. **External APIs** - Third-party data integration

### Data Validation Process
```python
# Example customer data structure
{
    "customer_id": "CUST_001234",
    "age": 35,
    "gender": "female", 
    "income": 65000.0,
    "tenure_months": 24,
    "monthly_charges": 79.50,
    "total_charges": 1908.0,
    "phone_service": true,
    "internet_service": "Fiber optic",
    "contract_type": "One year",
    "payment_method": "Credit card"
    # ... additional fields
}
```

### Data Quality Checks
- **Field validation** - Ensures all required fields present
- **Range validation** - Values within business-acceptable ranges
- **Consistency checks** - Related fields are logically consistent
- **Anomaly detection** - Identifies outliers and suspicious data
- **Completeness scoring** - Calculates data quality percentage

## 🔮 ML Model & Prediction Process

### How Predictions Work
1. **Data Reception** - API receives customer data
2. **Validation** - Comprehensive data quality checks
3. **Feature Engineering** - Transform raw data to model features
4. **Model Inference** - Run ML model to predict churn probability
5. **Risk Categorization** - Convert probability to business categories
6. **Recommendations** - Generate actionable business recommendations
7. **Response Delivery** - Return structured prediction response

### Model Versions & Management
```python
MODEL_REGISTRY = {
    "v1.0": {"accuracy": 0.85, "status": "deprecated"},
    "v2.0": {"accuracy": 0.87, "status": "testing"},
    "v2.1.3": {"accuracy": 0.89, "status": "active"}
}
```

### Business Logic
- **Low Risk (0-30%)**: Continue regular engagement
- **Medium Risk (30-60%)**: Increase touchpoints, send satisfaction survey
- **High Risk (60-80%)**: Retention campaign, offer 15% discount
- **Critical Risk (80%+)**: Urgent intervention, personal call from customer success

## 🧪 Test Cases & Quality Assurance

### Unit Tests (`test_data_ingestion.py`)
- **Data model validation** - Test Pydantic models catch invalid data
- **Data quality checker** - Verify quality assessment algorithms
- **Database connections** - Test connection handling and errors
- **File processing** - Validate CSV/JSON ingestion
- **Error handling** - Ensure graceful failure modes

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-end prediction flow** - Full API request/response cycle
- **Batch processing** - Multi-customer prediction workflows
- **Model switching** - Version deployment and rollback
- **Performance benchmarks** - Response time and throughput

### Performance Tests
- **Load testing** - 1000+ concurrent requests
- **Stress testing** - System behavior under extreme load
- **Memory usage** - No memory leaks during extended operation
- **Database performance** - Query optimization and connection pooling

### Sample Test Scenarios
```python
# Valid customer test
valid_customer = {
    "customer_id": "TEST_001",
    "age": 35,
    "income": 65000,
    # ... valid data
}

# Invalid customer test (catches errors)
invalid_customer = {
    "customer_id": "INVALID_001", 
    "age": 150,  # Too old
    "income": -5000,  # Negative
    # ... problematic data
}

# Batch processing test
batch_data = [valid_customer] * 100  # 100 customers
```

## 🏗️ Production Architecture

### System Components
1. **Load Balancer** - Distributes traffic across API instances
2. **API Servers** - Multiple FastAPI instances for scalability
3. **Database Cluster** - PostgreSQL with read replicas

5. **Model Storage** - Versioned ML models in object storage
6. **Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager

### Scalability Design
- **Horizontal scaling** - Add more API instances as needed
- **Database read replicas** - Separate read/write workloads
- **Caching layers** - Redis for fast data access
- **Async processing** - Background tasks for batch jobs
- **Queue systems** - Handle high-volume request spikes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### High Response Times
```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n ml-pipeline

# Optimize database queries
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 30;

# Solution: Add database indexes, increase instance size
```

#### Model Accuracy Drop
```python
# Monitor prediction confidence
recent_predictions = get_recent_predictions(days=7)
avg_confidence = sum(p.confidence for p in recent_predictions) / len(recent_predictions)

# Solution: Retrain model with recent data
if avg_confidence < 0.70:
    trigger_model_retraining()
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check connection pool
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'customer_churn_db';

# Solution: Increase pool size, optimize queries
```
