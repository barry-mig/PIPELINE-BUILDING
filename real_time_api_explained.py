# WHAT GIVES APIs REAL-TIME CAPABILITIES?

"""
The secret sauce that makes APIs real-time isn't magic - 
it's a combination of several key technical capabilities.
Let's break down each one.
"""

import asyncio
import time
from datetime import datetime
from fastapi import FastAPI

# 1. REQUEST-RESPONSE PROTOCOL (HTTP)
"""
APIs use HTTP - a request-response protocol that works instantly:

CLIENT REQUEST:  "Hey API, predict churn for customer 12345"
API RESPONSE:    "Customer has 85% churn risk - offer discount NOW"

This happens in MILLISECONDS, not hours/days like batch processing.
